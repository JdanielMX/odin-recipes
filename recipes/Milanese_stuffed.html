        In this recipe the breasts are breaded and the cheese inside is definitely gratinated,
        in such a way that when you bite into it, the sensation is absolutely exquisite, because
        you feel how the cheese, ham, chicken and panko explode in your mouth and one like diner
        surrenders to her.
